# Cache-Simulator
Created a cache simulator to understand a caches better
To store memory and data closer to the stack so it is quicker in retrieval and storing, rather then the data going to the
main memory.
Created a class of Cache containing an array of sets, and the sets containing a set of blocks/lines for which it stores
incoming data
